# MST
This program takes in a pre-defined set of points on a plane and returns the shortest distance required to visit each node. 

# Input file
The input file requires 3 things:
- The number of cases to test
- The number of nodes in that specific test case
- The node's x and y location

See [graph.txt](https://github.com/cjvickroy/MST/blob/main/graph.txt) for an example.

In the text file, you will find that there are 4 cases, as pointed out by the first line. 
The first test case has 3 nodes, as pointed out by the second line
The following 3 lines contain each node's coordinates.
Repeat

# How to compile and run

On a command line, run:

`g++ MST.cpp`
and
`./a.out`

Ensure that "graph.txt" is present in the same directory
